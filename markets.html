                  <p >What comes to your mind when you hear of a Trafalgar Square or a Piazza del popolo. The success of a retail development is when it draws people in, and makes the place so adorable that they want to stay, play and enjoy. It has to be designed keeping in mind the retail experience, to optimize spaces and enjoyment without neglecting the necessary considerations of flexibility, sustainability and best value. The two users in such type of spaces are the tenants and customers. The two factors while designing such spaces are marketability and adaptive reuse. Integrating sustainability methods into new and renovation projects helps in reducing maintenance and operating costs with due justice to the demands of the Occupier. A complete understanding of customer psychology, horizontal and vertical solution and designing spaces which are flexible in nature, helps us design more profitable spaces.</p>

                  <p >The healthcare sector has spaces ranging from extremely crowded waiting areas to sterile care and surgery rooms, which need critical attention towards developing a secure, safe and controlled environment at all levels and in all spaces. Challenges like Bio-Medical waste handling, patient safety, fire fighting measures and evacuation issues along with providing a therapeutic environment are the parameters, which sets apart an extraordinarily built hospital from a normal. Since these buildings essentially function 24/7, 365 days a year, a well-integrated, sustainable design approach is necessary. Its very important to bring in the nature into the hospital yet keep the aseptic spaces separate from the contamination.</p>

Sporting/Entertainment venues cater to large crowds, all of who cannot be relied upon to examine best practices to minimize wastage of building resources and energy, which is also due to the fact that they are not directly interfacing with the systems per se. Thus, to enable a better functioning venue/building, green and sustainable concepts need to be implemented early in the design process. We work with a close eye on viability, system optimization and integration, as well as an understanding of the cultural setting of the location, all to provide our clients with the best possible design, always looking at long term sustenance and sustainability. Be it stadiums, sports complexes, movie theaters, theme parks, cultural attractions or high end retail centers, each project would be looked upon with a fresh approach most suited to its typology and location</p>
