        <h3>Ramakrishna Math and Mission </h3>
        <p> My whole life is indebted towards Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission. I was fortunate to have cleared the Admission Tests of Ramakrishna Mission Vidyapith, Deoghar, Jharkhand, after being consistently pushed by the most amazing parents in this world. The physical journey spanned from 1999 to 2007, and these eight years made sure my spiritual quotient and the value system was extremely high. I grew up and spend the most valuable period of my life, growing from a child into an adult in this pious environment created by the most revered monks of the Ramakrishna Order and learned teachers, who were as dedicated as blood relatives. The teachings and the blessings of Thakur Sri Ramakrishna Paramhansa, Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi and the greatest leader and benevolent character the world has ever seen, Swami Vivekananda are deep rooted within me and as a token of gratitude, e-nviroGreen Design Services Private Limited will be contributing 10% of the entire profits, lifelong at the <b>service of humanity through the great institution called Ramakrishna Math and Mission, headquartered at Belur, Howrah, West Bengal, on the banks of the Holy Ganges. </b></p>

              <h2>Sri Ramakrishna Arogya Sansthan</h2>
              <p> When I was a student at the Deoghar Vidyapith, Swami Srikanthananda happened to be the Vice Principal for quite a significant period. Later in 2005, Swami Srikanthananda went on to establish Sri Ramakrishna Arogya Sansthan in Trimbakeshwar, Nashik, the Land of Lord Shiva.</p>
              <p>Shri Ramakrishna Arogya Sansthan is inspired by the nation building, life building teachings of Swami Vivekananda who advocated worship of Human Being as God. </p>
              <p>This non-profit organization is extremely active in the service of rural population, especially in the state of Maharashtra providing service on all layers of health viz. physical, mental, emotional, intellectual, social, spiritual and economical. </p>
              <p>e-nviroGreen Design Services Private Limited will be at the service of humanity through another 10% of its profits in its efforts to create <b>“sustainable development” for the mankind.</b></p>
