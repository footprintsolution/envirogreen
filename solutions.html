                        <p >“Architecture exists, like cinema, in a dimension of time and movement. One thinks, conceives and reads a building in terms of sequences. To erect a building is to predict and seek effects of contrast and linkage bound up with the succession of spaces through which one passes.” - Jean Nouvel</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>e-nviroGreen believes Architecture, if not sustainable is not architecture at all. The designs created by e-nviroGreen are created based on Solar Passive and Active Methodology by default, in accordance with the parameters and standards laid by the IGBC and GRIHA or any other Sustainable Design parameters, with special care to differently abled people of the world.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p> An architect is an artist, who visits the space; he is about to design in his thought first. He, indeed, is the first user, even before it’s built. But most importantly, this vision and thought, needs to be converted into the execution perspective. It helps immensely, in terms of saving the Money, Material, Manpower and Time, when one can visualize the built environment before it’s already built in form of a virtual model which details out the macro and micro details of the to-be built form. The Architecture division of e-nviroGreen acts as the bridge between the “dream” and the “dream come true.” </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>Creating relevant, world class and compelling solutions for every possible building /asset typologies, envirogreen aims to achieve a sense of sublimity in the design of the built environment, Where the enrichment of the human experience and spirit are reflected in both planning and architectural work and the need for a conscious effort towards creating architecture of excellence.</p>

                        <p >Landscaping is an art, done with the heart. The unbuilt space contributes as much as to the overall impact of a project as the built. A well designed and planned landscape complements the concrete and the steel structures integrating it with nature. At e-nviroGreen, we create imaginative design forms and gestures with nature to deliver a sense of place. Using locally available, draught resistant and a selection of softscape and hardscape contributes to the environment and its preservation as well. Adopting bio mimicry into form and concept for designs, a well thought-off landscaped space brings life to even dead and bad built infrastructure or even for industrial projects, it breaks the monotony.</p>
